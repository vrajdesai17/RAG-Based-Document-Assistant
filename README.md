# ðŸ§  RAG-based Domain-Specific Q&A System

This is a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that lets users upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It's designed for **domain-specific question answering** using OpenAI's LLMs and ChromaDB for local vector search.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload any PDF (e.g. academic papers, contracts, manuals)
- Ask natural language questions about the document
- Uses `SentenceTransformer` embeddings and OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` for answers
- Built with `Streamlit` for quick and interactive UI
- Chunking with overlap to preserve semantic context
- Stores and queries vector representations locally via ChromaDB

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running Locally

1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-Based-Domain-Specific-Q-A-System.git
cd RAG-Based-Domain-Specific-Q-A-System

2. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Set up .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

5.Run the app
streamlit run app/main.py

## ðŸ§¾ Example Questions for a research paper

Once you upload a PDF, try asking:
- "What is the main contribution of this paper?"
- "Which algorithm is used?"
- "What are the limitations discussed?"
- "Explain the methodology"
- "List the datasets used"

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Chunk size and overlap can be tweaked in processor.py
- Embedding model can be changed in vector_store.py
- Local vector DB (ChromaDB) is reset on reruns unless persisted in vector_db/
